WARNING

  This software is derived from a SIFT implementation which should be
  rather stable. However this particular version should still be
  considered a beta release as:

  * the command line driver sift-driver.cpp missess a few options to
    tune some parameters of the descriptor;

  * there are some new pieces of code (the command line driver,
    loading/saving PGM files, ...) which may contain bugs and

  * I didn't have time to test throughfully.

COPYRIGHT WARNING

  This code implements an algorithm (SIFT) which is D. Lowe's patent
  and cannot be used for commercial purposes without his
  permission. See the license notice attached to the source code
  files.
